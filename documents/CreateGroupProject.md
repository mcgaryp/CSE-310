### Create Accounts with JIRA
Each member of your team should create an account on [ATLASSIAN](https://www.atlassian.com). The team member assigned to be the Scheduler should create a board for the team project. Every team member should be invited to collaborate on the board. You must also invite your teacher to collaborate. In the board, you should provide the following 4 buckets or lists:  Not Started, Working, Blocked, and Completed.  An example is shown below:
 
As a team, start to add cards to the Not Started based on your understanding of the team project.  Include tasks related to planning, researching, implementing requirements, and testing.  Researching includes anything that you do not currently know how to do as well as the creation of prototypes. The scheduler should maintain this Trello board throughout the semester.  You will need to add more cards/tasks and move existing cards/tasks to different columns as the project progresses.  
Provide a web link to your Trello Board below:
